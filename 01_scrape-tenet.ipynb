       "'- [Vivek] If you want to\\nseal the border, vote Trump. If you wanna restore law and order in this country, vote Trump. If you want to defeat the\\ndeep state, vote Trump. (suspenseful music)\\n(keys rattling) - Hey, Johnny.\\n- Hey, Paji. - I\\'m having a really hard time wrapping my head around\\nthis story, I must admit. - Yeah, and this concept\\nof deep state has been so, I think poisoned by politics\\nand Trump sort of using it for everything that he doesn\\'t like. And it kind of makes it hard\\nto approach it earnestly, but I think we have to keep digging, like I think there\\'s something here. - Is the deep state real?\\n- Is the deep state real? (ominous music) (ominous music continues)\\n(glasses clinking) There\\'s this moment in the \\'60s (ominous music continues)\\n(rocket exploding) where you really like see\\nhow this actually works, like where power really is to the height of this moment where the US and the Soviet Union are in this like massive staring contest. There\\'s nuclear weapons involved. Everyone thinks the entire\\nglobe could be wiped out in this conflict. And Cuba is centered right\\nin the middle of it all, right off the coast of the US, but they\\'re on the Soviet\\nside of the conflict. The US at this point\\nwants nothing more than to snatch Cuba, to make it their own. And they\\'ve been trying to kill Fidel Castro a\\nmillion different ways. They\\'re looking for an excuse to invade and to push back on all of this, the Soviets actually start\\nshipping nuclear weapons to the island. (suspenseful music)\\nThe US has no idea until one day a spy plane\\nis flying over the island and they snap this wild photo. (suspenseful music continues)\\n(camera snapping) I mean, it doesn\\'t look like a wild photo, it just looks like a random field in Cuba. But you zoom in and you\\nsee canvas tents, trailers, missile launch equipment. I mean, the US government\\nimmediately knows what they\\'re looking at here. The world\\'s most destructive weapons are actually hiding under\\nthese tents, ready to launch, sitting right in the\\nUnited States\\' backyard, right off their coast,\\nnuclear war 103 miles away. - Within the past week, unmistakable evidence\\nhas established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on\\nthat imprisoned island. - It\\'s a crisis, a Cuban missile crisis. (suspenseful music) And one man in Washington DC suddenly has a really difficult decision to make. (suspenseful music continues) Everyone around him\\nwants him to invade Cuba, but he\\'s not sure. Okay, but here\\'s the\\nkicker of the whole thing. Instead of stay at work that night and like figure out this\\ncrisis with his advisors, Kennedy gets in a car and travels across town\\nto like a cocktail party. He came here to a house in Georgetown, the home of Joe Alsop, one of the nation\\'s most\\ninfluential newspaper columnists. It was the eve of nuclear war and the President of the United States kept his dinner date in Georgetown. And the reason why is\\nbecause at that party were the people he trusted, the people who really\\nhad power in Washington during that time. Most of them lived here\\nin this neighborhood, many of them side by side,\\nall within a few blocks. William Colby, the far\\neast chief of the CIA, he would later become the\\ndirector of the agency, Chip Bohlen, a former\\nambassador to the Soviet Union, Allen Dulles, who (exhales), boy, Allen Dulles,\\nwhere do you even start? He\\'s the CIA\\'s longest running director and he lived right here in Georgetown. Frank Wisner, one of the\\nfounding officers of the CIA, he lived just six blocks away. Felix Frankfurter, a\\nSupreme Court Justice, just a couple minutes walk away. And Kennedy himself had a\\nhouse in this neighborhood. (suspenseful music) The reason JFK kept his date\\nin Georgetown that night was because this is where\\npower in Washington was, on the other side of town\\nfrom the Capitol building, the seat of American democracy, the decisions were being\\nmade here by unelected men who had an immense amount of secret power. (suspenseful music continues)\\n(pictures clicking) These were powerful men who\\nwere not elected or accountable and at this point they\\'d\\nbecome drunk on the worst kind of power, the secret sort\\nof power that corrupts, the kind of power that our\\nfounders sought to check and balance with all of\\ntheir founding documents. But here in Georgetown, it had moved beyond anything the designers of the country could have predicted, into a shadowy separate part\\nof our government, a deep state that was actively\\nblackmailing the Congress and working to undermine the\\nPresident of the United States and being horrifyingly successful at it. - Unelected deep state\\noperatives who divide the voters to push their own secret agendas. - You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from\\nSunday at getting back at you. So even for a practical,\\nsupposedly hard-nosed businessman, he\\'s being really dumb to do this. - As far as I know, we don\\'t\\nengage in assassinations and kidnappings and things of that kind. - I do think there has to\\nbe serious questions raised about some of the foreign policy blunders that this country has had\\nover the last 20 to 25 years. - There\\'s some truth in the idea that there is an ongoing group of people who continue the work of government as administrations come and go. And is it possible for\\nthese entities to go rogue? Absolutely.\\n- Was the agency involved in the kind of domestic surveillance that has been portrayed\\nin the news reports? - My feeling is that it has not. - (sighs) Okay, I am doing this. The deep state, is the deep state real? And if so, what is it? Before we do that, I wanna take a moment to say thank you to our sponsor. NordVPN is a longtime\\nsponsor of our channel.

Paji, are you on the board over there? - [Paji] Right here,\\nwe\\'re here at the same. - [Johnny] Okay, if you can hear us. - I really want this.\\n- Could you start by introducing yourself,\\nwho you are, and what you do and what your relationship to this topic of the history of the CIA is? - Yeah, so my name\\'s Jefferson Morley. I\\'m a journalist in Washington. I\\'ve been a journalist in\\nWashington for the last 40 years. - In the old days, spy\\nagencies were a war thing. When the US was at war, it would set up an\\ninternational spy operation to best wage that war. And then when the war was\\nover, they would pare down or totally get rid of the spy agency. The thinking here was that a spy agency took up a lot of resources and\\nthreatened civil liberties, a lot of power concentrated into a bunch of unelected people. Worth it during war, not\\nworth it during peace. But then the biggest war of them all came to America\\'s Pacific doorstep\\nand it changed everything. - [Announcer 1] And in today,\\nthe bombing of Pearl Harbor by enemy units.\\n(bombs exploding) - And so Roosevelt now has a license, more of a license to do what he wants. And one of the first things he does is consult with a man named Bill Donovan. - [Johnny] Wild Bill, a\\ncorporate Wall Street lawyer who was obsessed with the\\npower of intelligence. - Donovan had very strong opinions and he said, \"You need a\\nwartime intelligence service. \"You\\'re going to war.\" - Wild Bill Donovan would be in charge of the Office of\\nStrategic Services or OSS, a centralized intelligence agency that would be given immense\\npower to do whatever it took to keep our people safe and\\nto keep our team on top. This was the birth of modern intelligence, a euphemism for spying,\\nand lying, and cheating, and deceiving, and sneaking, and breaking, coercing, dividing and conquering. No idea was too crazy for\\nthe OSS during this time. Like one OSS psychologist had this idea that Hitler could be demoralized if they just showed him\\na vast quantity of porn. - [Jefferson] Paramilitary operation. - [Johnny] Strapping\\nexplosives to a bunch of baths and letting them loose over Tokyo. - [Jefferson] A guy skiing\\ninto Nazi occupied Norway. - [Johnny] Making fake companies, recruiting off Wall Street\\nfrom all of his old colleagues, bringing in bankers and movie directors, fake radio stations,\\nanything to demoralize, divide or confuse the enemy. - The OSS is the first intelligence agency that the United States ever has. - Oh, and one of Wild\\nBill\\'s favorite things to do was to have parties at his house. - Hi, are we the first ones here? - [Announcer 2] It\\'s the big night. - [Johnny] To plan and plot his operations with his friends in Georgetown, a neighborhood in Washington DC that is strikingly beautiful. Here is Bill Donovan\\'s house. It\\'s now worth $17\\nmillion, it\\'s beautiful. And this is where he would have a drink and chat with other\\nWashington power brokers. He would recruit new agents\\nfrom American high society, earning the agency the nickname\\nOh So Social, pretty clever. Okay, but remember that\\nspy agencies like this were a war thing only,\\nand the war ended in 1945 and the OSS got dissolved. - The forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. - What do we do with the\\nOSS now that we\\'re at peace? And Truman says, \"We don\\'t want \"to risk having an American Gestapo.\" - A political police.\\n- His meaning, especially in the context of having\\njust defeated the Nazis, was, you know, that\\'s\\nwhat led our enemy astray. They had a secret intelligence\\nagency, the Gestapo, which wound up enforcing political norms and enforcing tyranny, and\\nwe don\\'t wanna risk that. - Here\\'s Harry Truman\\ndoing the right thing and signing a piece of paper that says that the OSS\\ncan no longer exist. I mean, Truman was freaked out. He\\'s like, this was really\\ngreat to help us win the war, but this is way too\\nmuch power in the hands of unelected officials\\nholding secret information. But it was kind of too late. Putting the genie back in the bottle would prove to be an impossible task. (ominous music) Is it significant that all\\nthese guys live four blocks from each other in Georgetown? - [Jefferson] Yeah, it\\'s very significant because they\\'re the product\\nof this wartime culture. - This is one party that\\njust has to turn out right. - Here is target number one for the Reds. And who\\'s in the bullseye? You are.\\n- So there was a brief moment after World War II when\\nthe Cold War didn\\'t exist. We were at peace. But then almost immediately\\ntension started to rise between these two great\\nempires that had been allies to defeat the Nazis, but were\\nnow skeptical of each other. And senators were suddenly\\ndeclaring that it was impossible to know where war begins\\nand where it ends. - The Soviet Union and its agents have destroyed the independence and democratic character of a whole series of nations in Eastern and Central Europe. - And this is when all the intel people that had run the OSS, many of them who lived in Georgetown\\nby the way, start calling for the resurrection of the OSS, a centralized intelligence\\nagency that we can use to fight this new global\\nwar with the Soviet Union. But no, say a bunch of other lawmakers, the Constitution wasn\\'t designed for us to put so much power in the hands of men who are doing secret things. Doing this will result\\nin, \"A police state run \"by power grabbing bureaucrats.\" (ominous music continues) Too much power to, \"Military leaders,\" and their, \"Insatiable\\nappetite for more money, \"for more men and more power, \"whatever the cost to democracy.\" - Truman\\'s mind changed. And what changed Truman\\'s mind\\nwas the growing confrontation with the Soviet Union. - And soon the papers were signed and a new agency was formed, the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. - When Truman signs the\\nNational Security Act, he says, \"We have to be careful \"that we don\\'t have an American Gestapo.\" So that thought is still on his mind. - The CIA was the big shiny new weapon of the United States in the Cold War and their mission was to, quote, \"Gain and distribute intelligence,\" and to perform, quote,\\n\"Other functions and duties \"related to intelligence\\naffecting national security.\" What does that mean? - Everybody knew what that language meant. Everybody knew that that was, and we just weren\\'t gonna talk about it because we didn\\'t wanna\\nwrite it down on paper. - Like what do they do\\nwith this vague mandate of national security? - Oh boy, they go to town.\\n- Who\\'s that? (crowd chattering) - [Announcer 3] You must\\nstir the ingredients in your chocolate cake. - [Announcer 4] \"The Tonight Show.\" (screen screeching)\\n- So clean but so soft and smooth.\\n(ominous music continues) - Operation Paperclip, 1945 to 1959, the Americans wanted to get\\nthose Nazi rocket scientists on their side so that they could develop\\ntheir own rocket capacity. James Angleton, for example, protects a general under Hitler. - CIA, gets involved in\\nthe Italian elections. - Italian elections, 1948, puts its thumb on the Italian democracy and make sure that US allies win. - [Johnny] Operation\\nAjax, coup in Iran, 1953. - [Jefferson] The CIA and\\nthe MI6 organized a coup to overthrow the democratically\\nelected government. - Now that we encouraged the Shah to take that action I will not deny. - [Johnny] CIA coup,\\nGuatemala, 1954, bananas, for of course, bananas.\\n- [Jefferson] Again, democratically elected\\ngovernment reformists wanted to engage in land reform and the CIA overthrows\\nit really at the behest of the United Fruit Company. - The CIA is now helping\\nAmerican corporations? - [Jefferson] The influence\\nof American corporations on the CIA actions is unmistakable. Allen Dulles was on\\nthe board of directors, Howard Hunt, Birch O\\'Neal, David Phillips, CIA coup in Congo.\\n- Congo. - [Jefferson] Early 1960s,\\nCIA coup in Chile, 1973. (suspenseful music)\\n- Las Vegas. - The assassination operation\\nagainst General Schneider in 1970 is coordinated\\nwith Kissinger\\'s office. - Thank you, nice to see you all. - [Johnny] Mind control\\nexperiments, MKUltra. - In 1950, the CIA\\nlaunches a massive program to develop means of\\ncontrolling people\\'s minds. Some 40 US academic institutions were involved in this kind of research. - [Johnny] Feeding LSD to\\npeople without their permission. - [Jefferson] Can we\\ndevelop a truth serum, dosing somebody with\\nLSD 60 times in a week? NSA\\'s Operation Shamrock. - [Johnny] Operation Shamrock. - [Jefferson] Electronic\\nsurveillance, 1945 to 1975, the first warrantless wire tap. - Oh God, Bay of Pigs nightmare. - [Jefferson] There were hundreds of CIA assassination plots.\\n- Operation Phoenix. - [Jefferson] Eventually Bill\\nColby, who was later director, admitted that they had\\nkilled 20,000 people. - Operation Mockingbird. - [Jefferson] COINTELPRO.\\n- [Johnny] COINTELPRO, Operation Chaos,\\nWatergate, Jim Critchfield, Frank Wisner, James Angleton,\\nRoosevelt, John Foster, McCoy. - [Jefferson] The CIA coup in\\nIndonesia, CIA coup in Greece, CIA involvement in the\\nGuatemalan Civil War. It was a CIA crime spree for 20 years. There\\'s no other way to describe it. (suspenseful music) - So by the 1970s, the\\nCIA is this powerful, well-funded machine of intelligence that is doing a lot of secret\\nthings all around the world. They start blackmailing lawmakers to scare them away from investigating them and reigning them in. - These agencies had\\nharmful personal information on lots of people. When I was doing my Angleton book, a guy told me one day when\\nhe went to meet Angleton, Angleton quoted back to him\\nwhat he had said to his wife in bed the night before.\\n- Jesus. - And so, they had this capacity and people knew that\\nthey had this capacity. You know, the Kennedys knew that J. Edgar Hoover had\\ninformation about his affairs with various women. ♪ Happy birthday, Mr. President ♪ - This kind of knowledge that they had, Angleton and Hoover were masters at using those kind of secrets as leverage. Kennedy had this thing\\nhanging over his head and he knew Hoover, you\\nknow, had that on him. And so, you know, he couldn\\'t fire Hoover. - And so much of this\\npower is concentrated among just a few people,\\nmany of them not elected, and many of them living right\\nhere along these streets in this neighborhood of\\nGeorgetown, living in fancy homes, having fancy cocktail parties and kind of running the Western world. It\\'s exactly the nightmare of\\nthe founders of the country and the nightmare of President Truman. - And one month after the assassination of President Kennedy, Harry\\nTruman publishes an article in the \"Washington Post\" and says, \"The CIA should be abolished.\" - Wow.\\n- And he says, \"It has cast a shadow on\\nthe historical reputation \"of the United States.\" - The man who signed the piece of paper that created the CIA comes\\nout and says he regrets it. Eventually Americans start\\nto get savvy to the fact that their government is\\nsort of going off the rails. (suspenseful music)\\n(bell ringing) As this war in Vietnam drags on, more and more Americans\\nstand up and say enough, demanding accountability for\\na national security apparatus that had gotten out of control. And what does the\\ngovernment do in response? They start spying on the protestors. - Operation Chaos was the CIA spying on the anti-war movement. Johnson calls in Dick Helms\\nand says, \"What\\'s going on?\" They said, \"Communists\\nhave to be behind this.\" And so they start infiltrating\\nthe anti-war movement and they come back in about a year and they say, \"Well, you know, Moscow \"and the North Vietnamese, \"they really like this anti-war movement, \"but it\\'s not controlled by\\nthem, it\\'s not funded by them. \"It\\'s pretty much an\\nAmerican thing, you know, \"but that doesn\\'t change anything.\" And Chaos continues to grow\\nand eventually by 1970, there\\'s 30 officers working\\non it, hundreds of agents. And you know, the\\nostensible purpose of Chaos, to detect a foreign hand, I mean, Chaos was in\\nexistence for seven years, every time they were asked to\\nreport on it, they came back and said, it\\'s not foreign controlled and it\\'s not foreign\\nfunded, which was obvious to anybody who was involved\\nin the anti-war movement. There were a lot of people\\ninside the CIA saying, \"You know, we\\'re spying on\\nour wives and kids basically, \"you know, they\\'re going\\nto the demonstrations \"and we\\'re reading the reports at night. \"We shouldn\\'t be doing this.\" - Are we trying to\\nexterminate an entire people? What have we become as a nation? - Americans were waking up to the fact that these unelected men were\\nwielding way too much power and spying not only on the entire world, but on Americans themselves. (suspenseful music) - We have been victimized\\nby excessive secrecy, not only with respect to\\nthe failure of the Congress in the past to exercise\\nproper surveillance over intelligence activities, but also excessive secrecy\\nhas created this kind of mischief within the executive branch. - [Johnny] Senator Frank\\nChurch helps lead the charge of taking all of these\\nsecrets and excesses and thrusting them onto the national stage and shining a light on them. - There has never been\\na full public accounting of FBI domestic intelligence operations. - The American people are learning for the first time just how bad this was. 800 witnesses, 10,000 documents. Their secrets were shared. CIA, FBI, NSA, assassination plots. - Does this pistol fire the dart? - [William] Yes, it does, Mr. Chairman. - [Frank] When it fires,\\nit fires silently? - [William] Almost silently, yes. - Spying on Americans. - A wholly comprehensive listing of everything those people fought or did on any subject you can imagine, they\\'re having a concern with. - [Johnny] Targeting people\\nlike Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights\\nor feminist activists. - Bureau agents were told\\nto attack the new left by disinformation and misinformation. - [Johnny] Anti-war protestors\\nwere spied on, intimidated. - COINTELPRO is the name\\nfor the effort by the bureau to destroy people and to\\ndestroy organizations, or as they used the words,\\ndisrupt and neutralize. The bureau went so far as\\nto mail anonymous letters to Dr. King and his wife. \"King, there is only one\\nthing left for you to do. \"You know what it is. \"You have just 34 days in\\nwhich to do it, you are done.\" - That was taken by Dr.\\nKing to mean a suggestion for suicide, was it not? - [Frederick] That\\'s our\\nunderstanding, Senator. - The CIA\\'s LSD mind control experiments were also detailed to the public. - [Jefferson] One of the\\nfirst things they come across is the MKUltra papers. - And so were the FBI and CIA\\'s attempts to infiltrate the free\\npress, planting journalists within our newspapers. We would later learn in\\nsome investigative reporting that this infiltration of the free press was much more widespread\\nthan Church even discovered. - He reported that up to 400\\njournalists had been paid by the CIA under Operation Mockingbird. And there\\'s no doubt that\\nit was a massive effort and effective.\\n- The Church committee made a few things clear,\\nnumber one, that indeed a group of unelected government\\nemployees used immense power and resources of the\\nUnited States government to pursue programs that\\nwere illegal, unethical, and generally out of line with\\nAmerican values and norms. And they did it in secret outside of any set of accountability, partly because the US Congress\\nwanted to give them money and turn a blind eye. - I can recall members of Congress who recoiled from responsibility of knowing what was happening, members of Congress who said, \"Don\\'t tell me, I don\\'t wanna know.\" I think that is an\\nindictment of the Congress just as severe as any indictment which is labeled against any\\nof the intelligence community. - When Dulles wanted to get\\napproval for the CIA budget, all he had to do was\\ntake a top line number to the chairman of the Senate\\nArmed Services Committee and he would say, \"This is\\nwhat we want for this year.\" And the chairman of the Senate\\nArmed Services Committee would say, \"Okay, that\\'s what you\\'ve got \"and please don\\'t tell us anything \"about what you\\'re doing with it.\" And so there was no internal challenge to this world of CIA people. - But here\\'s the other thing\\nthat is so crucial here, which is that when you\\nlisten to these hearings, you see people who thought they\\nwere doing the right thing, who thought that they were\\ndoing what they needed to to protect the country\\nduring a very scary time. - After a 30 year period, all of a sudden, you woke up one morning\\nand here was this creature that had been created\\nthat no one along the line had ever really contemplated. Each of these steps that I think initially were innocent, honest steps. - Many of these agents\\nwere earnest patriots, but they were operating in a system free of accountability and transparency. - Even within the deep\\nstate, there are people who were doing things for\\naltruistic and good reasons. And then there are people\\nwho were doing things for their own selfish or bad reasons. And you know, exactly how\\nmany are in each category, is you know, sort of\\nimpossible to delineate. - I got sucked in when I\\nshould have known better and where many other more intelligent, sophisticated people got\\nsucked in in other areas. - So after the Church committee, all kinds of new oversight\\nregulations come in. There\\'s new committees formed,\\nthere\\'s new regulations, and suddenly the intelligence\\ncommunity now finally has some kind of oversight. The deep state was reigned in. Now they did fight back. Church was undermined and\\nintimidated by these agencies. - CIA people, I mean,\\nthey hated Frank Church. Jim Angleton would go around and say, \"Frank Church was a KGB agent.\" Dick Helms raged against him. Kissinger, they couldn\\'t believe that US intelligence was being opened up. On the other hand, Americans\\nwere like, \"Oh my God, \"this is what was being done in our name?\" - But overall, this is a\\nstory of American democracy, doing what it\\'s supposed to do, reign in the worst impulses\\nof humans with power, and in the process avoiding disaster at least for a few decades. - One of you is about\\nto be elected the leader of the single most powerful\\nnation in the world. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power? - When it comes to foreign policy, that\\'ll be my guiding question. Is it in our nation\\'s interests? Peace in the Middle East is\\nin our nation\\'s interests. Having a hemisphere\\nthat is free for trade. (screen screeching)\\n(crowd cheering) - Have some very, very sketchy\\ndetails reaching us here at SkyCentral, important\\nenough to bring to you though, at this early stage. We believe that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. (suspenseful music continues)\\n- Gotta move back! - [Johnny] A new threat. (suspenseful music continues)\\n(pedestrians yelling) And a new call to give\\npower to professional spies and bureaucrats to keep us\\nsafe by doing secret things. - And by passing the Patriot\\nAct, we will make America safer while safeguarding our\\ncivil liberties and privacy. - [Johnny] And then of\\ncourse, new agencies, all with variations on the same name. - 9/11 is kind of like a Pearl Harbor. There\\'s this desire, you\\nknow, we\\'ve been attacked. Anything goes, we have to strike back. This is an existential struggle. And that same ethos of the Early Cold War, anything goes, that returns\\nbig time after 9/11, and the CIA seeks or asserts\\nwithout being checked, all sorts of powers that\\nthey hadn\\'t asserted before. They implement the torture program, they massively expand the\\nwarrantless wiretapping, the kind of things that we\\nhad seen Angleton do in Chaos. Those exact same techniques are revived and expanded after 9/11, you\\nknow, on a very large scale. - Taxpayers funneling money into millions of new top secret jobs. 22 capital buildings\\nworth of new office space that spring up all around\\nthis area where I live, to house all these new secrets, and inside them waterfalls\\nof new programs, so many weirdly named programs that no one leader could ever hear about, let alone regulate all of them. - There\\'s not a whole lot of effective oversight on something that has grown so big and so bushy. - [Johnny] And none of which\\nshould be known to the public, that is until someone\\nwho\\'s worried that history is repeating itself,\\ndecides to spill the beans. - Our breaking news this evening\\nis the identity of the man who sent the Obama Administration into defend and explain mode this week. His name is Edward Snowden. He\\'s an American former CIA employee and computer technician. Today he came out as the leaker\\nof classified NSA documents that spell out a secret. - [Johnny] And we all kind of wonder, what if we actually need this now? What if we need all these dark windows and top secret PowerPoint\\ndecks where they design how they\\'re gonna spy on us? What if our safety relies\\non what happens inside of all these buildings? So we keep funding them, but in doing so, we must at least acknowledge\\nwhat we\\'re doing here. We are trading a portion of our freedom in exchange for a sense of security. And in the process we\\'re creating and feeding kind of a new branch of our government to power,\\none that operates outside of this elegant triangle that\\nthe founders constructed, to trip up the corrupting\\nforces that run the risk of always possessing\\nmen with secret power. - Most everybody agrees that\\nthere\\'s over classification, there\\'s way too much\\ninformation that\\'s classified, but information is power, and\\nthe fewer people that have it, the more power the people\\nthat do have it have. - [Johnny] And the result is\\nthat when the most powerful man in the world arrives to\\nthe most powerful House in the world, promising\\nto reign all of this in, to reign in the excesses, he\\nactually finds that he can\\'t. He\\'s not able to change much of it. Instead, he sits there and\\nwatches much of the things that he critiqued grow under his watch, the thing that he\\'s supposed to control he finds he doesn\\'t have\\nthat much control over. - These targeted strikes\\nagainst Al-Qaeda terrorists are indeed ethical and just. - Secrets keep us safe, but secrets also degrade\\nthis delicate thing that we have called\\ndemocracy and accountability, that is until we save ourselves from their everlasting seductive pull. - The United States must\\nnot adopt the tactics of the enemy, means are\\nas important as ends, crisis makes it tempting to ignore the wise restraints\\nthat make men free.
